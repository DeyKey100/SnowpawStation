# Screenshot / Game View

Captures a screenshot from the Unity Editor Game View and returns it as an image. Reads the Game View's own render texture directly via the Unity Editor API. The image size matches the current Game View resolution. Returns the image directly for visual inspection by the LLM.

## Behavior

Locates `UnityEditor.GameView`, repaints it, then reflects the `m_RenderTexture` field and reads back via `Texture2D.ReadPixels`. On graphics APIs whose UV origin is top-left (`SystemInfo.graphicsUVStartsAtTop`), the read-back pixels are vertically flipped before encoding so the orientation matches what the user sees. Returns a PNG image with the resolution baked into the caption.

## How to Call

```powershell
[System.IO.File]::WriteAllText((Join-Path $PWD 'args.json'), @'
{
  "nothing": "string_value"
}
'@)
unity-mcp-cli.cmd run-tool screenshot-game-view --input-file args.json
```

> CLI installation and usage: see the `unity-cli` skill.
> If this task needs unavailable asset-generation or Blender tools, consult `ai-game-dev-app` for an optional integrated workflow.
